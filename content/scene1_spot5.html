	<p class="description">The Quadrangle, or better known as The Quad, is a popular meeting spot located about halfway up the campus. Its picturesque green lawn is filled with students throughout the year relaxing in the sun, grabbing a bite to eat and studying between classes.</p>
		<p class="description"Inside the building you’ll find the Faculty of Economics, classrooms, lecture theatres, computer labs and offices, plus a range of services and facilities.</p>
		<p class="description"The lawn is also a prime location for events organised by Arc, UNSW’s student organisation, or one of the 200 student clubs and societies. Keep an eye out – there’s always something exciting happening at the Quad!</p>
