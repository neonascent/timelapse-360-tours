At this location you’ll find a food court, bookstore, bank and ATM, convenience store and a travel agent.</p><p class="description">The Quad Food Court is a central eating area with indoor and outdoor tables. Spread across two levels, you can take your pick from sushi, Thai, burgers, kebabs, noodles, café sandwiches and more.</p><p class="description">Outdoor tables have built-in power sockets so you can charge your phone or laptop, or keep studying or working while you eat. It is also a great place to socialise and randomly run into friends.</p>
