		<p>UNSW was the first university in Australia to generate solar power on campus and we did it right here at the Quad. In 2005, we installed a 42kWp photovoltaic array (solar panels) on the roof of the Quadrangle Building. The electricity produced is used throughout the building.</p><p>Since 2005, we have added 10kW panels to the Fitness and Aquatic Centre, 18kW panels on the childcare centres and a 146kW system on top of the Tyree Energy Technology Building.</p><p>Itâ€™s all part of our continued dedication to renewable energy and why we hold the world record for solar cell efficiency.</p>
